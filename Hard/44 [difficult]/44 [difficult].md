For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function that takes two arguments a and b, and finds all primes that are between a and a + b (specifically, find all primes p such that a â‰¤ p < a + b). So for instance, for a = 1234 and b = 100, it should return the following 15 primes:

1237, 1249, 1259, 1277, 1279, 1283, 1289, 1291, 1297, 1301, 1303, 1307, 1319, 1321, 1327

The sum of those primes are 19339. The number of primes for a = 9! and b = 8! is 3124 and the sum of those primes is 1196464560.

How many primes are there for a = 16! and b = 10!, and what is their sum?

Note 1: In this problem, n! refers to the factorial of n, 1*2*3*...*(n-1)*n, so 9! is equal to 362880.

Note 2: All numbers and solutions in this problem fit into 64-bit integers.

EDIT: changed some incorrect numbers, thanks ixid!
