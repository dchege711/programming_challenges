#  (Hard): Polygon diagonals
(#HardIcon)
In how many distinct ways can you divide a regular N-sided polygon into N-2 triangles using N-3 non-intersecting diagonals?

For instance, there are 3 ways to do divide a regular hexagon (6-sided polygon) into 4 triangles using 3 non-intersecting diagonals, as shown here: http://i.imgur.com/gEQHq.gif

A diagonal of a regular polygon is a line joining two non-adjacent vertices. Two diagonals are non-intersecting if they don't cross within the interior of the polygon. Two ways are distinct if one cannot be rotated and/or reflected to become the other.

What's the largest N that your program can handle in a reasonable amount of time? Post the solution for N = 23 if you can get it.
