For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that draws a square spiral. You can print out this spiral in ASCII text, but using a graphics library would produce a more pleasant output.

Bonus: Now draw a normal spiral. Some samples of spirals can be found here.
