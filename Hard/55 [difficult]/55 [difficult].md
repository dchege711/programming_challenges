For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program to implement the Pollard's rho algorithm using both, Floyd’s cycle-finding algorithm and Brent’s cycle-finding algorithm ..

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Brent.27s_algorithm)
Bonus: also compare the timings for the implementation of both the algorithms and come up stating whichever is the fastest.
