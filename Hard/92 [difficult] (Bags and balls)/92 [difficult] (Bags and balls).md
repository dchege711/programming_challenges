# [92 (difficult) (Bags and balls)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/ywm28/8272012_challenge_92_difficult_bags_and_balls/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Compute all the permutations of placing 9 balls into 4 bags such that each bag contains an odd number of balls.

Ball count is transient when placing bags within one another. For example, a bag containing 3 balls is placed inside a bag containing 2 balls. The inner bag contains 3 balls and the outer bag contains 5 balls.

Some example permutations:


```
((((9))))
(8(((1))))
(1)(1)((7))
```
