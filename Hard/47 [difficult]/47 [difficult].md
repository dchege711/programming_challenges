For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

If you were to generate all permutations of the first three letters of the alphabet ("a", "b" and "c") and then sort them, you would get the following list of 6 permutations:

As you can see, the fourth permutation in a sorted list of all the permutations of "a", "b" and "c" is "bca".

Similarly, if we wanted the 30th permutation in a sorted list of all permutations of the first five letters of the alphabet (i.e. "abcde"), you get "baedc".

Define a function f(n,p) that generates the permutation number p in a sorted list of all permutations of the n first letters of the alphabet. So, for instance: 

f(3, 4) = "bca"
f(5, 30) = "baedc"
f(7, 1000) = "bdcfega"
f(8, 20000) = "dhfebagc"    

Find f(11, 20000000)

Bonus:

Find f(20, 1018 )
