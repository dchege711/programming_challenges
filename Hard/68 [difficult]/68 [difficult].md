For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Implement a program you can use to play the classic game of chess. White and black alternate inputting their moves using some form of chess notation. The computer checks if the moves are legal and if so, executes them. The program should be able to tell whenever a player is in check or check-mate. You can represent the chessboard in the terminal in ascii form.

Bonus: implement a simple AI that can play chess against you.
