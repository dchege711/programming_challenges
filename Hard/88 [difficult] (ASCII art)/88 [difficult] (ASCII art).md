For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that given an image file, produces an ASCII-art version of that image. Try it out on Snoo (note that the background is transparent, not white). There's no requirement that the ASCII-art be particularly good, it only needs to be good enough so that you recognize the original image in there.
