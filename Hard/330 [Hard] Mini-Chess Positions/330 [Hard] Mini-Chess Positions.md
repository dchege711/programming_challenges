Please feel free to provide feedback. I'm a decent chess player myself, however I have never played mini-chess and am not 100% versed in its rules and variations.

Grammar and links. I have limited the parameters of this challenge from the original posting, because as /u/J354 rightly pointed out, the original problem is being pursued by professionals and may have over a quadrillion possible solutions.
