# [109 (Difficult) (Steiner Inellipse)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/126976/10252012_challenge_109_difficult_steiner_inellipse/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

For the difficult challenge, you must find the Steiner Inellipse of a triangle.  The Steiner Inellipse is the ellipse within a triangle that has the maximum area, without exceeding the bounds of the triangle.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_inellipse)
For example: here is an image of a typical inellipse.

For your input, you will be given the three coordinates of a triangle.  They are:

For your output, you have two options: either use some sort of graphical implementation to draw the found ellipse, or output the equation of that elipse.

Any further information can be found here at a similar problem on projecteuler.net.

Good luck, and have fun!
