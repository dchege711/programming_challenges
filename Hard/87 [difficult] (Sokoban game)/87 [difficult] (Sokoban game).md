For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Sokoban is an old PC puzzle game that involves pushing boxes onto goal squares in a puzzling warehouse layout. Write your own simple Sokoban clone (using a GUI, or curses) that can read level files in .xsb format from the command line and play them.

For extra credit, extend your program to include a level editor, allowing the user to draw his own levels and save them as .xsb files.
