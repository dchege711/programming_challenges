For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that will take coordinates, and tell you the corresponding number in pascals triangle. For example: 

Input: 1, 1

output:1

input: 4, 2

output: 3

input: 1, 19

output: error/nonexistent/whatever

the format should be "line number, integer number"

for extra credit, add a function to simply print the triangle, for the extra credit to count, it must print at least 15 lines.
