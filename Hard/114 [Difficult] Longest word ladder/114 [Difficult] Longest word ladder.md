# [114 (Difficult) Longest word ladder](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/149kic/1242012_challenge_114_difficult_longest_word/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

What's the longest valid word ladder you can make using this list of 3,807 four-letter words without repeating any words? (Normally a word ladder would require you to take the shortest possible path between two words, but obviously you don't do that here.)

Here's a ladder I found of 1,709 words. What's the best you can do? Also post the code you used to generate it, of course.
