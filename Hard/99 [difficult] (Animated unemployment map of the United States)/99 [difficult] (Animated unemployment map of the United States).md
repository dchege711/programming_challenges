# [99 (difficult) (Animated unemployment map of the United States)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/101mpd/9172012_challenge_99_difficult_animated/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Improve the program from today's intermediate problem to make it be able to create not just still images of unemployment, but animations of how unemployment has changed over time, with the maps as the frames of animation. The output can either be in the form of animated gifs or a movie file.

Your program should be fully automated: it should take as inputs the start and end date, and produce the finished animation. As in the previous problem, any extra information on the map is optional, but for this problem it is strongly recommended (though, again, not required) that you list the date, so you can see when each map is represented. 

Create an animation that shows how unemployment developed from 2000 to today. I imagine it would get quite interesting around 2007. Please show us the results you get, either by uploading the animations to imgur.com (if they're animated gifs) or to YouTube (if they're movie files)!
