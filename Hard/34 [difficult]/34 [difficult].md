For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Inspired by the restaurant I ate at the other day. This is the puzzle: You have a wooden triangle, roughly equilateral with 5 rows of holes. The top row has one hole, and the bottom has 5, increasing by one hole with each successive row.

One hole of the triangle is empty and the rest are filled with golf tees. To make a move, you jump a golf tee over another adjacent golf tee into a hole immediately beyond it, removing that second golf tee from the game. Your goal is to find a solution set of jumps such that all of the golf tees but one are removed from the board. The notation of such a solution is at your discretion.

Bonus: Investigate if the choice of initial empty hole influences the solvability of the problem, and if so, what is the maximum number of pegs that can be removed given each starting hole.
