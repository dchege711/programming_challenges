# [177 (Hard) SCRIPT it Language](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2exnal/8292014_challenge_177_hard_script_it_language/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description:
We all enjoy strings. We all enjoy breaking up texts. Time to go bigger than just a few sentences.

Out of curiosity we will be breaking down a movie script. The movie I have picked is Monty Python and the Holy Grail. 

So what do you mean by breaking it down? Our challenge is to crunch some numbers on this movie and figure out some fun statistics.

You will first go get the text of this script off the web. Part of the challenge is how to deal with this.

I really like this Monty Python and the Holy Grail Script script of the movie.

# By Scene:
# By Whole Movie:
At the end of the crunch we want this data.

Top 3 Scenes with the most Words spoken (Again if ties - both are listed as 1 spot)

In the movie there are a bunch of characters known as the Knights of Ni. They cannot say the word "it" (forbidden) - Count how many times this forbidden word is used and list a count of "Forbidden Word of the Knights of Ni"

# Output:
Given the above you will have to format and display the data. I leave the design up to you. But it should be easy to read and understand. 

# Extra Challenge:
Find a way to show this data more meaningful than just list of hard data. Develop a Histogram or format the data into a format that makes a cool looking pie chart/table/graph.
