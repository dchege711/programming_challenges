# [104 (hard) (Image color analyzer)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/11ss0k/10202012_challenge_104_hard_image_color_analyzer/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Sorry for taking the last challenge down but it seems it was already done. I had searched for "slide puzzle" -- what they're usually called -- but not "15 puzzle."

Anyway, new challenge! Make a program that analyzes the color of an image. What the majority colors are, specifically. Output if they fall into red, blue, green, etc. because saying "1 instance of <obscure color here>" takes of space, especially if that obscure color is a blue or red or green.

Example input:

$ color_analyze image.jpg


```
$ color_analyze image.jpg
```
Example output:

Pixels that are red: 15
Pixels that are blue: 227
Pixels that are green: 1,745


```
Pixels that are red: 15
```

```
Pixels that are blue: 227
```

```
Pixels that are green: 1,745
```
