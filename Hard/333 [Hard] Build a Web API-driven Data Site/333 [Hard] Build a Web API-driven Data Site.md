# Description
A common theme in present-day programming are web APIs. We've had a previous challenge where you had to consume an API, today's challenge is to implement one. Today's is relatively simple: a single CSV file as input that can probably be represented by a single database table. 

Your solution may use whatever technologies you wish to build on:

This challenge focuses less on the guts of the server and more on routing requests, transforming a request into a data extraction method, and returning those results. 

Today's challenge will utilize the State of Iowa - Monthly Voter Registration Totals by County data set: 


```
https://data.iowa.gov/Communities-People/State-of-Iowa-Monthly-Voter-Registration-Totals-by/cp55-uurs
```
Download the JSON, CSV or other and use that as your input. It contains 19 columns and over 20,000 rows. Now expose the data via a web API. 

Your solution must implement the following API behaviors:

This challenge extends Wednesday's idea of practicality and real world scenarios. Wednesday was some basic data science, today is some basic application development. It's open ended.

# Bonus
Ensure your API is immune to attack vectors like SQL injection.
