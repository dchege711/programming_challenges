# [298 (Hard) Functional Maze solving](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5mzr6x/20170109_challenge_298_hard_functional_maze/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

There will be a part 2 challenge based on bonus.  I am sure we have done maze solving before, but its been a while, and challenge is mainly about the bonus.

Borrowing from adventofcode.com, http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/24, solve the following maze returning the path (length) visiting nodes labelled 1 to 7 starting from 0.  # are walls.  May not travel diagonally.  Correct answer for path length with this input is 460

(http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/24)

```

```

```
460

This is a fairly large maze, and you may wish to resort to one of the main graph algorithms that minimize how often a node cost is calculated.  Namely Astar... though there are other options.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
# bonus
For the bonus, the requirement is to use higher order functions for your algorithm.  The "end function" should be one with the simplest interface:

searchfunction(start, goal, mazeORgraph)

called to solve paths from 0 to 1, would be called with searchfunction(0,1,abovemaze)

You might handcraft this function to solve the problem without the bonus.

To build this function functionally, inputs to the higher order function include: 

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function)
Your higher order function might transform the functional inputs to fit with/bind internal state structures.

The general idea behind this higher order functional approach is that it might work with completely different reference inputs than a start and goal symbol, and a 2d map/maze.  Part 2 will request just that.

# bonus #2
Enhance the functional approach with for example:

default functional parameters, where perhaps all of functions used to solve a 2d maze, are the defaults if no functions are provided to the higher order function.

a dsl, that makes multi-function input easier.

# P.S.
Unfortunately, there may not be any other challenges this week.  Other than part 2 of this challenge on Friday.
