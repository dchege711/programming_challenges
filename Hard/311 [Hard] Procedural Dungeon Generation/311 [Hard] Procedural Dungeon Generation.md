# Description
I've been a fan of text-based interactive fiction games for a long time, and used to play Zork a lot as a kid, as well as Rogue. In college I got into MUDs, and several years ago I wrote a small MUD engine called punymud in an effort to see how much could be done in a small amount of code.

I encourage you to have fun, build on each other's work (and even work collaboratively if you wish), and see where this takes you. If you like this sort of thing, there's a group of subreddits devoted to that type of thing.
