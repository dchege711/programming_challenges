For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Create a piece of code that downloads an entire album from imgur. It should support multiple arguments. e.g.

imgurDownloader http://imgur.com/a/0NZBe http://imgur.com/a/OKduw

(http://imgur.com/a/0NZBe)
(http://imgur.com/a/OKduw)
The url might get a bit redundant for large batch's, so consider leaving out the link, so one just needs to enter 0NZBe OKduw ect. You can use a third party librarys.

Tip: every single image link in an album is listed in the source code.

Bonus points: You can enter the directory you would like to save the files but it's optional. Extra bonus points: if you can change all the file-names into something readable, that's also customizable. For example if I wanted all my images called wallpapers001, wallpapers_002, ect. I would just add wallpapers# as an argument.

thanks to koldof for this challenge!
