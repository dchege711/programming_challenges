# [85 (difficult) (Bitwise arithmetic)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/xq385/832012_challenge_85_difficult_bitwise_arithmetic/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

While basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. seem 'natural' to us, computers think on a very different level: under the hood, computations work with bitwise operations, using operators like ~, &, |, ^, and <<. Your task is to implement functions for (integer) addition, subtraction, negation, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation, without using any "high-level" operators like + and *. Other statements like "if" and "while", or recursion for functional languages, are fine.

```
~
```

```
&
```

```
|
```

```
^
```

```
<<
```

```
+
```

```
*
```
As a hint, you could start with a helper function that increments a binary number, and work from there. Your functions should take signed integer arguments and return signed integer values, rounding down (e.g. binary_div(14, 4) == 3, not 3.5).


```
binary_div(14, 4) == 3
```

```
3.5
```
Use your set of functions to implement this function:

```
f(a, b, c, d, e) = (a % e) * (b / (c - a) + exp(d * (-b), e))
```
What is the result of f(50, -40, 300, 2, 3)?


```
f(50, -40, 300, 2, 3)
```
