# [94 (difficult) (Simple Lisp interpreter)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/z6o5o/9012012_challenge_94_difficult_simple_lisp/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Lisp is a family of programming languages, known for its extremely simple notation (called S-expressions) in which programs are defined as lists and code can be modified as data. Your task is to write an interpreter for a simple subset of Lisp.

Peter Norvig wrote a popular article on how to write a simple Lisp interpreter in only 90 lines of Python. You can choose to port his code to a language of your choice, or write one on your own, from scratch. Bonus points for solving today's easy challenge (or maybe even this challenge) in your own Lisp dialect!
