# [76 (difficult) (imgur album downloader)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/wk0jf/7132012_challenge_76_difficult_imgur_album/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a script that takes an imgur album id and an output directory as command line arguments (e.g., ./script DeOSG ./images), and saves all images from the album in the output directory as DeOSG-1.jpg, DeOSG-2.jpg, etc.

```
./script DeOSG ./images
```

```
DeOSG-1.jpg
```

```
DeOSG-2.jpg
```
