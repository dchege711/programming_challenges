# [306 (Hard) Generate Strings to Match a Regular Expression](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5zxebw/20170317_challenge_306_hard_generate_strings_to/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
Most everyone who programs using general purpose languages is familiar with regular expressions, which enable you to match inputs using patterns. Today, we'll do the inverse: given a regular expression, can you generate a pattern that will match?

For this challenge we'll use a subset of regular expression syntax:

To tackle this you'll probably want to consider using a finite state machine and traversing it using a random walk.  

# Example Input
You'll be given a list of patterns, one per line. Example:


```
a+b
abc*d
```
# Example Output
Your program should emit strings that match these patterns. From our examples:


```
aab
abd
```
Note that abcccccd would also match the second one, and ab would match the first one. There is no single solution, but there are wrong ones. 


```
abcccccd
```

```
ab
```
# Challenge Input

```
[A-Za-z0-9$.+!*'(){},~:;=@#%_\-]*
ab[c-l]+jkm9*10+
iqb[beoqob-q]872+0qbq*
```
# Challenge Output
While multiple strings can match, here are some examples.
