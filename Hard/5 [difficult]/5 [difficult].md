Arrr, me mateys! Yer' challenge fer' today be a tough one. It be gettin awfully borein' on the high seas, so yer' job be to create a pirate based fightin' game! This game oughter' be turn based, and you oughter' be able to pick yer attacks every turn. The best game'll be winnin' some custom flair, and all the rest o' ya will be walkin the plank!
