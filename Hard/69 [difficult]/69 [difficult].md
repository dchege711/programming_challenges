For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

The ADFGVX cipher described in today's intermediate problem turned out to be quite a challenge for the Allied powers, but it was finally cracked by the French cryptanalyst Georges Painvin. It is said that the work was so difficult and involved such complex techniques that it made him physically break down from the fatigue. His method required lots of similar messages encrypted during periods of high traffic.

Today we have an advantage that Painvin didn't have: massive computational power at our fingertips. Your difficult task for the day is to try and crack a message that have been encrypted using the ADFGVX cipher as defined in today's intermediate problem, without knowing either of the keys. To make the task a little bit easier, I'll give you a few hints regarding the message and how it's been encrypted:

Those hints should be enough for you to be able to crack it, but if no one has succeeded in 24 hours, I'll give a few more hints. If you have an idea about how to solve it, but isn't quite sure, I encourage you to post your thoughts so others can see them and maybe develop on them.

Here is the ciphertext:
