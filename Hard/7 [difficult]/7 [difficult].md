For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

This challenge will focus on creating a bot that can log into Reddit!

Write a program that can log into a working Reddit account. 

Since this challenge is vague, bonus points are awarded for a few different things:

If the bot can navigate the site and view posts

If the bot can make posts

If the bot can make statistics from the front page/any subreddit. These statistics include time on front page, number of comments, upvotes, downvotes, etc.

The more functionality in your bot, the better.
