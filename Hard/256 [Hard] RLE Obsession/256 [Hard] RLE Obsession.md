# [256 (Hard) RLE Obsession](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/48w88o/20160304_challenge_256_hard_rle_obsession/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

run length encoding is a simple and magical data compression technique that I would like to use as a database.  But we will just be experimenting with querying and updating ranges of rle data without "decompressing" the rle data.

# 1. eazy: run length indexes
run length indexes (RLI) is an array representation of binary data (list of booleans) as a list of indexes (numbers that are not booleans).

An rli list of 1000 represents 1000 0s.
An rli list of 0 1000 represents 1000 1s.
An rli list of 2 3 7 10 represents 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1. 


```
1000
```

```
0 1000
```

```
2 3 7 10
```

```
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
```
RLI is more of an in memory representation rather than a storage format, but can be computed efficiently from this packed RLE format

challenge
create an RLI function, and optionally a packed RLE function

input  (one per line)
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

alternate input: bitsize, number
10 135
32 12311231
32 2147483713

Packed RLE output
2 0 3 2
8 0 0 2 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5
0 0 23 0 4 0

RLI output
2 3 7 10
8 9 10 13 14 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 32
0 1 25 26 31 32

# 2. [Med] range query on RLI data
for 32bit binary 2147483713 the (0 based) indexes from 23 to 30 are: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0


```
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
```
Can you query the RLI data directly to obtain binary substrings?

input format is:  start_index, length, RLI data
0 9 2 3 7 10
5 14 8 9 10 13 14 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 32
23 4 0 1 25 26 31 32

output
2 3 7 9
3 4 5 8 9 13 14
2 3 4

# 3. [Hard] overwrite RLI data with RLI data at an offset
to overwrite the string 1 1 1 starting at index 3 overinto 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 results in the output string 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1


```
1 1 1
```

```
3
```

```
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
```

```
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1
```
The same problem with RLI data is to overwrite the RLI string 0 3 starting at index 3 overinto 2 3 7 10 results in 2 6 7 10


```
0 3
```

```
3
```

```
2 3 7 10
```

```
2 6 7 10
```
input format: start_index, RLI_newdata > RLI_intodata
3 0 3 > 2 3 7 10
3 1 3 > 2 3 7 10
3 1 3 > 10
3 1 3 > 0 10
3 0 3 7 10 12 15 > 8 9 10 13 14 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 32

output
2 6 7 10
2 3 4 6 7 10
4 6 10
0 3 4 10
3 6 10 13 15 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 32

# Note: CHEATING!!!!
For Medium and Hard part, it is cheating to convert RLI to bitstrings, query/overwrite and then convert back to RLI.  These functions are meant to be run on sparse bitstrings, trillions of bits long, but with short RLI sequences.

# bonus
these functions can be used to solve the "Playing with light switches" recent challenge here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/46zm8m/20160222_challenge_255_easy_playing_with_light/

(https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/46zm8m/20160222_challenge_255_easy_playing_with_light/)
though there is also a shortcut to negate a range of bit values in RLI format (hint: add or remove a single index)
