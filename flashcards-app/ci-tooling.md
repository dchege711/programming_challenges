What automatic tools can I add to keep code quality high?

## CodeQL

CodeQL is a tool that runs variant analysis on code. The idea is that we
create a query from a known vulnerability, e.g., SQL injection, and then
run it against a codebase to find instances of that vulnerability. {{%
cite CodeQL %}} GitHub authorizes the use of CodeQL for public repos,
and so we are covered {{% cite CodeQLLicense %}}.
[ql-analysis.sh](https://github.com/dchege711/study_buddy/blob/main/ql-analysis.sh)
has a recipe for running the analysis locally in the repo. CodeQL also
runs on every PR, and blocks check-in if new vulnerabilities are
discovered.

Variant analysis is a common term in the medical field for analyzing
genetic variants between individuals of a population. {{% cite

medical interpretation, implying that the use of the term is pretty new
in the software field.
