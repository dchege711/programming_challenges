title: 344. Write a Web Client
weight: 344
---

## Description

Write a web client from scratch that can fetch the contents of a HTTP url using a GET request and display them on the console. Use low level `socket()` calls.

Bonus points if you can do POST requests, TLS or SSL, and arbitrary headers.
