## Mixins

{{% comment %}}

Introduced to mixins by {{% cite mixinsLit %}}. Didn't know that there
are passionate advocates for this, e.g., {{% cite fagnani2015 %}}'s "You
can even look at normal subclass inheritance as a degenerate form of
mixin inheritance where the superclass is known at class definition
time, and there's only one application of it."

A mix-in is an abstract subclass. This technique is especially useful in
languages where a class can only have a single superclass.

```js
const calculatorMixin = (Base) =>
  class extends Base {
    calc() {}
  };

const randomizerMixin = (Base) =>
  class extends Base {
    randomize() {}
  };

class Foo {}
class Bar extends calculatorMixin(randomizerMixin(Foo)) {}
```

Folks use mixins to provide a lot of optional features for a class, or
use one particular feature in a lot of different classes. One way to
think about mixins is a small base type designed to add a small amount
of functionality to a type without otherwise affecting that type. {{%
cite mixinUsefulnessSO %}} Mixins are rarely useful as standalone
objects. One can think of it as an interface with an associated
implementation. {{% cite mixinVsInheritanceSO %}}
