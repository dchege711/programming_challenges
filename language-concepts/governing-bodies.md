## JavaScript

The European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) manages and prioritizes
proposals written by community members to decide what's included in each spec.

{{% cite TC39PublishedStandards %}} contains the published standards, e.g., {{%
cite ECMA2024 %}}. Conveniently, {{% cite ECMA2024 %}} contains a summary of
what each annual release introduced to JavaScript.
