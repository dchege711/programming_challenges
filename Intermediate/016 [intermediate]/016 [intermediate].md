For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Craps is a gambling game

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps)
Your task is to write a program that simulates a game of craps. 

Use the program to calculate various features of the game: 

for example, What is the most common roll or average rolls in a game or maximum roll? What is the average winning percentage? Or you can make your own questions.

edit: if anyone has any suggestions for the subreddit, kindly post it in the feedback thread posted a day before. It will be easier to assess. Thank you.
