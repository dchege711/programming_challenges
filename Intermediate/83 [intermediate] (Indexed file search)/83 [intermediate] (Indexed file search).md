For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

For this challenge, write two programs: 

The speed of the "index" program doesn't matter much (i.e. you don't need to optimize it all that much), but "search" should finish very quickly, almost instantly. It should also scale very well, it shouldn't take longer to search an index of 10000 files compared to an index of 100 files. Google, after all, can handle the same task for billions/milliards* of documents, perhaps even trillions/billions!

(*see easy problem for explanation)

Index a folder where you have a lot of text files, which on my computer would probably mean the folders where I store the programs I've written. If you don't have a lot text files, head over to Project Gutenberg and go nuts. 

Good luck!
