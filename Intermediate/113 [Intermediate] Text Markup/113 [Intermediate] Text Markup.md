# [113 (Intermediate) Text Markup](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/13hmz5/11202012_challenge_113_intermediate_text_markup/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Description:

Many technologies, notably user-edited websites, take a source text with a special type of mark-up and output HTML code. As an example, Reddit uses a special formatting syntax to turn user texts into bulleted lists, web-links, quotes, etc.

Your goal is to write a function that specifically implements the Reddit markup language, and returns all results in appropriate HTML source-code. The actual HTML features you would like to implement formatting (i.e. using CSS bold vs. the old <b> tag) is left up to you, though "modern-and-correct" output is highly desired!

Reddit's markup description is defined here. You are required to implement all 9 types found on that page's "Posting" reference table.

Formal Inputs & Outputs:

Input Description:

String UserText - The source text to be parsed, which may include multiple lines of text.

Output Description:

You must print the HTML formatted output.

Sample Inputs & Outputs:

The string literal *Test* should print <b>Test</b> or <div style="font-weight:bold;">Test</div>


```
*Test*
```
