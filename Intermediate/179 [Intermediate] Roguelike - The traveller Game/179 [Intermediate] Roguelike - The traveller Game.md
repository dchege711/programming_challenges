# [179 (Intermediate) Roguelike - The traveller Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2g1c80/9102014_challenge_179_intermediate_roguelike_the/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description:
So I was fooling around once with an idea to make a fun Rogue like game. 
If you do not know what a Rogue Like is check out Wikipedia Article on what it is about.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)
I got this really weak start at just trying to generate a more graphical approach than ASCII text. If you want to see my attempt. Check out my incomplete project FORGE

(http://coderd00d.com/Forge/index.html)
For this challenge you will have to develop a character moving in a rogue like environment. So the design requirements.

# input:
Some keyboard/other method for moving a hero up/down/left/right and way to end the game like Q or Esc or whatever.

# output:
The 20x20 map with the hero updating if you can with moves. Show how much movement points you have and score.

At the end of the game show some final score box. Good luck and have fun.

# Example:
ASCII Map might look like this. (This is not 20x20 but yours will be 20x20) 

A simple dungeon.


```
%%%%%%%%%%
 %..$.....%
 %......$.%
 %...@....%
 %....$...%
 %.$......%
 %%%%%%%%%%
 Move: 100
 Score: 0
```
# Creative Challenge:
This is a creative challenge. You can use ASCII graphics or bmp graphics or more. You can add more elements to this. But regardless have fun trying to make this challenge work for you.
