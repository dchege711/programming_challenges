# [107 (Intermediate) (Infinite Monkey Theorem)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/122c6d/10252012_challenge_107_intermediate_infinite/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Verify the Infinite Monkey Theorem.

Well that's a bit hard, so let's go with this. Using any method of your choice, generate a random string of space-separated words. (The simplest method would be to randomly choose, with equal probability, one of the 27 characters including letters and space.) Filter the words using a word list of your choice, so that only words in the word list are actually output.

That's all you need for the basic challenge. For extra points, run your program for a few minutes and find the most interesting string of words you can get. The longer the better. For style, see if you can "train your monkey" by modifying either the random character generator or the word list to output text that's more Shakespearean in less time.
