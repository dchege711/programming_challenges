For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that draws a recursive image.

For example, a Sierpinski triangle, a Barnsley fern, or a Mandelbrot set fractal would be good drawings.

Any recursive image will do, but try to make them look fun or interesting.

Bonus points for adding a color scheme!

Please post a link to a sample image produced by your program, and above all, be creative.
