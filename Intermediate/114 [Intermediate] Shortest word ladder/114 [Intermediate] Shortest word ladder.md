# [114 (Intermediate) Shortest word ladder](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/149khi/1242012_challenge_114_intermediate_shortest_word/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Given any two words from this list of 3,807 four-letter words, output a word ladder between them that's as short as possible, using words from the list. (Note that the word list was chosen so that it's possible to form a ladder between any pair of words in the list.) Sample input:

(http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/149kec/1242012_challenge_114_easy_word_ladder_steps/)

```
look
leap
```
Sample output (any valid ladder of 5 words from look to leap would also work):


```
look
```

```
leap
```

```
look
loon
loan
lean
leap
```
Bonus: There are 8 pairs of words that require a ladder of 18 words to join. Find these 8 pairs of words. (Hint: a certain word appears in each of the 8 pairs.)
