For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Reverse Polish Notation(RPN) is a mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, to add three and four, one would write "3 4 +" rather than "3 + 4". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written "3 − 4 + 5" would be written "3 4 − 5 +" first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form.

You can assume that for the test cases below only single letters will be used, brackets [ ] will not be used and each expression has only one RPN form (no expressions like abc)

Test Input:

(a+(b*c))

((a+b)*(z+x))

((a+t)*((b+(a+c)) ^ (c+d)))

Test Output:

abc*+

ab+zx+*

at+bac++cd+ ^ *
