# Description
A polyomino is a collection of cells (equal-sized squares) which are connected, that is, each cell shares a border with another one. Think about tetris pieces, those would be tetrominoes - they each have four squares, and there are 5 unique combinations of their squares into unique shapes. Polyominoes are considered equivalent if they can be made to look identical if they are rotated or flipped. For additional background on polyominoes see this link: http://home.adelphi.edu/~stemkoski/mathematrix/polys.html
