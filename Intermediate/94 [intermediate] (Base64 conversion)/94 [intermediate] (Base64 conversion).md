# [94 (intermediate) (Base64 conversion)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/z6p3l/9012012_challenge_94_intermediate_base64/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Create a function which accepts a byte array and outputs a Base64 equivalent of the parameter. Write a second function that reverses the progress, decoding a Base64 string.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
Obviously, you can't use a library function for the encode/decode.
