# [310 (Intermediate) Simplifying square roots](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/64y4cf/20170412_challenge_310_intermediate_simplifying/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
Simplify square roots in the form (a sqrt(b))/(c sqrt(d)). A simplified radical should have no square roots in the denominator and no number in a square root should have a square factor. For example, the input 2 5 5 10 for a b c d, respectively, should simplify to 1 2 5 where a=1, b=2, and c=5.


```
(a sqrt(b))/(c sqrt(d))
```

```
2 5 5 10
```

```
a b c d
```

```
1 2 5
```
# Output description

```
a b c
```
(d should not exist after simplifying)

# Challenge input

```
45 1465 26 15
```
# Challenge output

```
15 879 26
```
