# [102 (intermediate) (n-character-set strings)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/10pf4a/9302012_challenge_102_intermediate_ncharacterset/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function that takes a string s and an integer n, and returns whether or not the string s contains at most n different characters.

For example, ncset("aacaabbabccc", 4) would return true, because it contains only 3 different characters, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and 3 â‰¤ 4.


```
ncset("aacaabbabccc", 4)
```

```
true
```
For how many English words (yes, it's time for this dictionary again!) does ncset(word, 4) hold?

```
ncset(word, 4)
```
