For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that will print the english name of a value. for example, "1211" would become "one-thousand, two hundred, eleven".

for extra credit, allow it to read the english value of a number and output the integer. 

input: one-hundred, four
output: 104
