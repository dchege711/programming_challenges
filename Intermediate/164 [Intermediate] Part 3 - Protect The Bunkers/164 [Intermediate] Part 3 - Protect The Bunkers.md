# [164 (Intermediate) Part 3 - Protect The Bunkers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/26oop1/5282014_challenge_164_intermediate_part_3_protect/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

## Description
Most of the residential buildings have been destroyed by the termites due to a bug in /u/1337C0D3R's code. All of the civilians in our far-future society now live in bunkers of a curious design - the bunkers were poorly designed using the ASCII Architect and are thus not secure. If the bunkers are breached by a hostile force, it is almost certain that all the civilians will die.

(/u/1337C0D3R)
The high-tech termites have developed a taste for human flesh. Confident from their victory at the building lines, they are now staging a full attack on the bunkers. The government has hired you to design protective walls against the termite attacks. However, their supplies are limited, so you must form a method to calculate the minimum amount of walls required.

A map of an area under assault by evil termites can be described as a 2d array of length m and width n. There are five types of terrain which make up the land:

Termites will begin their attack from the nest. They will then spread orthogonally (at right angles) through terrain they can pass through.

A map will always follow some basic rules:

## Formal Inputs And Outputs
## Input Description
Input will be given on STDIN, read from a file map.txt, or supplied as a command line argument. The first line of input will contain 2 space separated integers m and n. Following that line are n lines with m space seperated values per line. Each value will be one of five characters: *, #, +, -, or o.

Input Limits


```
1 <= n < 16
3 <= m < 16
```
## Output Description
Output will be to STDOUT or written to a file output.txt. Output consists of a single integer which is the number of walls required to protect all the bunkers.

## Sample Inputs and Outputs
## Sample Input 1
6 6

#++++*

#-#+++

#--#++

#ooo--

#ooo-#

######

## Sample Output 1
2

(The walls in this example are placed as follows, with @ denoting walls:

#++++* 

#@#+++

#--#++

#ooo@-

#ooo-#
