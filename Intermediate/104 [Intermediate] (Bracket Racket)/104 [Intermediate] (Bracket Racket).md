For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Description:

Write a function, where given a string of arbitrary characters, returns true if all brackets (defined as parentheses, square-brackets, curly-braces, and chevrons) are correctly paired and ordered. This is to say that all brackets, if they enclose other brackets, enclose both the paired opening and closing characters.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket)
Formal Inputs & Outputs:

Input Description:

string data - a given string that may or may not have correctly formed brackets.

Output Description:

Return True or False - true if the given string is correctly bracket formed.

Sample Inputs & Outputs:

"123", "(abc)", "()abc()", and "([<{abc123abc}>])" should return true, but "(abc[123)abc]" (wrong pairing) and "(abc>" (not closed) should return false.

Notes:

This is a very easy problem if you use a specific primitive data-structure.
