For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

create a program that can remove all duplicate strings from a .txt. file. for example, "bdbdb" -> "bd"

we are really sorry about this :( .. I just woke up now and am looking at this disaster. We promise to give a bonus question soon ...

for those who still have time, here is the modified question:  

remove duplicate substrings.  

Ex: aaajtestBlaBlatestBlaBla ---> aaajtestBlaBla

another example:  

aaatestBlaBlatestBlaBla
aaathisBlaBlathisBlaBla
aaathatBlaBlathatBlaBla
aaagoodBlaBlagoodBlaBla
aaagood1BlaBla123good1BlaBla123

output desired:
aaatestBlaBla
aaathisBlaBla
aaathatBlaBla
aaagoodBlaBla
aaagood1BlaBla123

I am really sorry for the vagueness. Hopefully will not be repeated again :(
