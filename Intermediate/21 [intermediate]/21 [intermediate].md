For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

This idea is to implement the haar wavelet transform on an array of length 2n . This algorithm is a critical algorithm for many image compression and image processing applications, and it is relatively simple both recursively and iteratively.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet)
The solution should take in as input an array of floating-point values, and return an array of floating point values that in some sense implements the haar wavelet transform.
