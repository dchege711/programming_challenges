For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Implement the hyperoperator as a function hyper(n, a, b), for non-negative integers n, a, b.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation#Definition)
hyper(1, a, b) = a + b, hyper(2, a, b) = a * b, hyper(3, a, b) = a ^ b, etc.

Bonus points for efficient implementations.
