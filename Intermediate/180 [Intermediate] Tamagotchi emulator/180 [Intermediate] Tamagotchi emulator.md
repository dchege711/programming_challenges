For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
You're lonely and bored. Your doritos are stale and no one is online, this loneliness you feel has a cure...A TAMAGOTCHI

For those of you who have never heard of a Tamagotchi, here's a quick summary:

A tamagotchi is a virtual pet whose life you must sustain through various activities including eating, playing, making it sleep, and cleaning its poop. Tamagotchi's go through several life cycles, most notably, egg/infant, teen, adult, elderly. Tamagotchi's can die from lack of attention (in the classic ones, half a day of neglect would kill it) and also from age.

Your job is to create a tamagotchi via command line, gui or any other avenue you'd like.
