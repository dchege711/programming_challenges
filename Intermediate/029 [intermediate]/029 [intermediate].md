For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

This is a simple web frontend and web server (CGI, PHP, servlet, server component, etc.) exercise.  Write a web frontend that contains a text area and button.  Then write a program that accepts the contents of the text area and writes them out to a file.  When the user clicks the button, the submission of the content can be either form-based, AJAX-based, or even websockets-based.

You can complete this project in several ways.  You can write up the HTML yourself and submit the form to a program written in C/C++, Perl, Python, PHP, etc.  You can do all the work in Javascript and hit a server using Node.js.  You can also show off how easy it is to do this project using a Java/Python/Ruby/etc. web framework.
