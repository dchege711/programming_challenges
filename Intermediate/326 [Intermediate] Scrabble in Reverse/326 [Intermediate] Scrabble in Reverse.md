# Description
Many of us have played Scrabble, the game where you lay down tiles of letters on a board to form interlocking valid English language words. Players get points depending on the tiles they play and the bonus squares they use per word. 

Now, can you reverse a Scrabble game? That is, given a board can you infer what words were played and in what order?

For your dictionary, use any standard English language dictionary (or enable1.txt).

# Example Input
You'll be given two integers on a line telling you how many rows and columns to read, then a board (with those dimensions) with words filled out, with blank spaces using a period .. Example:


```

```

```
7 8
...cite
.tilt..
...e...
.planes
...n...
.......
.......
```
# Example Output
Your program should emit one or more words, in the order in which they were played (first to last). Example:


```
planes

cite
```
