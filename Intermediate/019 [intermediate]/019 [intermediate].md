For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Challenge #19 will use The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes from Project Gutenberg.

(http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1661/pg1661.txt)
(http://www.gutenberg.org)
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is composed of 12 stories.  Write a program that counts the number of words in each story.  Then, print out the story titles ordered by its word count in descending order followed by how many words each story contains.  Exclude the Project Gutenberg header and footer, book title, story titles, and chapters.
