For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Given a binary matrix like this:


```
0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 0
```
Output the clues for a nonogram puzzle in the format of "top clues, empty line, bottom clues", with clues separated by spaces:

```
3
1 2
1 3
5
5
3

4
1 3
1 4
6
4
```
That is, count the contiguous groups of "1" bits and their sizes, first in columns, then in rows.
