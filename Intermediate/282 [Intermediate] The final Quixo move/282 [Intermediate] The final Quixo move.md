For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
Quixo is a grid based game. The game is played by 2 groups, one being x and other being o.

(https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3190/quixo)

```
x
```

```
o
```
The goal of the game is to get 5 blocks in a row.
The blocks can only be taken from the sides and must be placed in a line, pushing all the other blocks.

from boardgamegeek:

On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.

If the block comes from a corner, you have 2 options

|You can only move your own blocks or blanco block directly. If you use a blanco block, then that block becomes yours.

For those who can't make up the rules by reading this, you can watch this 2 min instruction video.
