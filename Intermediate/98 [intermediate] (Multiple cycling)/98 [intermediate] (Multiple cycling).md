For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function that takes two arguments: a limit, lim, and a list of integers, x. The function counts up from 0 by cycling through x and skipping numbers until we find the next number that's a multiple of x[i]. For example, when x is the list [5, 7, 3], start counting from 0:

When the count reaches lim or a number above it, return the number of steps it took to reach it. (multiple_cycle(15, [5, 7, 3]) would return 6.)


```
multiple_cycle(15, [5, 7, 3])
```
What is the result of multiple_count(1000000000, [5395, 7168, 2367, 9999, 3])?


```
multiple_count(1000000000, [5395, 7168, 2367, 9999, 3])
```
