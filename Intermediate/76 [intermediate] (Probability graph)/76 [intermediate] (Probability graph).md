# [76 (intermediate) (Probability graph)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/wk066/7132012_challenge_76_intermediate_probability/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function graph(f, low, high, tests) that outputs a probability graph of the function f from range low to high (inclusive) over tests tests (i.e., counting the frequencies of f() outputs). f takes no arguments and returns an integer, low, high and tests are all integer values. For example, a function f that simulates two-dice rolls:


```
graph(f, low, high, tests)
```

```
f
```

```
low
```

```
high
```

```
tests
```

```
f()
```

```
f
```

```
low
```

```
high
```

```
tests
```

```
f
```

```
def two_dice():
    return random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6)
```
Then graph(f, 2, 12, 10000) should output something roughly like:


```
graph(f, 2, 12, 10000)
```

```

For bonus points, output the graph with the numbers on the bottom and the bars drawn vertically.
