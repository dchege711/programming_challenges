For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Many ancient buildings and scriptures use Roman numerals to express numbers or years. Let's say you discover a bunch of formulas using these numerals, but some of the letters used in them are unreadable, like this:

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)

```
LX?I
```
That ? could be an I, V, or X, giving you these possibilities:


```
LXII = 62
LXVI = 66
LXXI = 71
```
Write a function guess_roman that outputs all possibilities for an input string containing any number of question marks. For example, guess_roman("X??I") outputs:


```
guess_roman
```

```
guess_roman("X??I")
```

```
XIII = 13
XVII = 17
XXII = 22
XXVI = 26
XXXI = 31
XLII = 42
XLVI = 46
XCII = 92
XCVI = 96
```

```
guess_roman("D??I")
```

```
guess_roman("???????")
```
