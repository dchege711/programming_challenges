For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that, given an ASCII binary matrix of 0's and 1's like this:


```
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000011001110000
0000001111010000
0000011001110000
0000011011100000
0000000000110000
0000101000010000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
```
Outputs the smallest cropped sub-matrix that still contains all 1's (that is, remove all borders of 0's):


```
01100111
00111101
01100111
01101110
00000011
10100001
```
