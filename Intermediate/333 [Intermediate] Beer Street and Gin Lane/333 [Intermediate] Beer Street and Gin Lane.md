For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
The US state of Iowa has relesed over a year's worth of liquor sales data, great for data mining. In this practical exercise we'll be asking you to do some large scale data analysis. Hopefully this data set is big enough that you have to make some decisions about data structures and algorithms and don't just sort | uniq. 


```
sort | uniq
```
This particular challenge differs from many we do because I anticipate you'll use languages and tools such as SQL, LINQ, and similar, although if you feel like using a more conventional programming language please do. My objective with this particular challenge is to explore a data science type of a challenge, inspired by some comments earlier this year seeking more practical challenges. 

The title of this challenge refers to artwork by William Hogarth.

# Questions to Answer
EDIT After reading this comment that does a great job explaining the data set (I had misinterpreted it when I wrote this up), i edited the questions. Also I don't think Iowa tracks beer sales in this category.

Challenges for you to consider include runtime analysis and performance. 

Feel free to highlight any insights you find and how you found them - that's in scope for this challenge.

# Get the Data
You can get the data on the Iowa data website. Export it to get it into a format (e.g. CSV) suitable for coding - don't bother trying to scrape it!
