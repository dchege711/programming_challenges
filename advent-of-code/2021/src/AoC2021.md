  --  hGetContents is lazy in that data is only read as the characters are
  --  processed. The lazy evaluation of the string is transparent, and so it can
  --  be passed to pure functions without any issues. However, if we try to hold
  --  onto `s` past the call to `numIncreases`, then we lose the memory
  --  efficiency as the compiler is forced to keep its value in memory for future
  --  use. Note that closing a handle before fully consuming its results will
  --  make you miss on the stream's data that had not been evaluated before the
  --  handle's close. [1] [2]
