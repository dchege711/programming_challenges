Objective: Get better at Haskell, and at functional programming in
general. Picks up from Haskell learnings in [Project Euler 021]({{< ref

>}}) and [Project Euler 022]({{< ref

## Setup {{% cite AoC2021-01 %}}

You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard
alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the
Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleight keys flying into the
ocean!

Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for
situations like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because of
course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be
able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength by
displaying 0-50 stars.

Your instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you'll need to
get all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on
each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
