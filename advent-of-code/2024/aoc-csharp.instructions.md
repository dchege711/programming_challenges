title: LLM Instructions for Advent of Code Using C#
weight: -1
---

The project uses modern C#. The user is an experienced programmer who has been
writing C# for a year. Before that, the user mostly wrote imperative object
oriented C++ code.

Reference concepts from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/ where
appropriate.

Beware of the user writing non idiomatic code, e.g., being too imperative where
a declarative or functional programming approach might be better suited.
