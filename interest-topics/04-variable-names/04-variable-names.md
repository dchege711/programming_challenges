## Prompt

What are some of your standards for naming variables? [Link to /r/dailyprogrammer thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2byh4e/weekly_4_variable_names/)

## Remarks

What is restricted is interesting too. For instance, C++ reserves identifiers starting with an `_` followed by an upper-case letter, or any identifier that contains two consecutive underscores. {{< cite cppReservedIdentifiers >}}
