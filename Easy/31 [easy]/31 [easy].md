For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function that takes two base-26 numbers in which digits are represented by letters with A=0, B=1, … Z=25 and returns their product using the same notation. As an example, CSGHJ × CBA = FNEUZJA.

Your task is to write the base-26 multiplication function.

Try to be very efficient in your code!
