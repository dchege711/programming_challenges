# [284 (Easy) Wandering Fingers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/53ijnb/20160919_challenge_284_easy_wandering_fingers/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
Software like Swype and SwiftKey lets smartphone users enter text by dragging their finger over the on-screen keyboard, rather than tapping on each letter.

You'll be given a string of characters representing the letters the user has dragged their finger over.

For example, if the user wants "rest", the string of input characters might be "resdft" or "resert".

# Input
Given the following input strings, find all possible output words 5 characters or longer.

# Output
Your program should find all possible words (5+ characters) that can be derived from the strings supplied.

Use http://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt as your search dictionary.

(http://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt)
The order of the output words doesn't matter.

# Notes/Hints
Assumptions about the input strings:

# Bonus
Double letters in the output word might appear only once in the input string, e.g. "polkjuy" could yield "polly".

Make your program handle this possibility.
