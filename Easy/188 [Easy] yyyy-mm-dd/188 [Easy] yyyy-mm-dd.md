# [188 (Easy) yyyy-mm-dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2lvgz6/20141110_challenge_188_easy_yyyymmdd/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description:
iso 8601 standard for dates tells us the proper way to do an extended day is yyyy-mm-dd

A company's database has become polluted with mixed date formats. They could be one of 6 different formats

(month word) can be: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

Note if is yyyy it is a full 4 digit year. If it is yy then it is only the last 2 digits of the year. Years only go between 1950-2049.

# Input:
You will be given 1000 dates to correct.

# Output:
You must output the dates to the proper iso 8601 standard of yyyy-mm-dd

# Posting Solutions:
Please do not post your 1000 dates converted. If you must use a gist or link to another site. Or just show a sampling 

# Challenge Idea:
Thanks to all the people pointing out the iso standard  for dates in last week's intermediate challenge. Not only did it inspire today's easy challenge but help give us a weekly topic. You all are awesome :)
