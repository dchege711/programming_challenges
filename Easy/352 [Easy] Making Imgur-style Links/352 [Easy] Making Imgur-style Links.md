# [352 (Easy) Making Imgur-style Links](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7yyt8e/20180220_challenge_352_easy_making_imgurstyle/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
Short links have been all the rage for several years now, spurred in part by Twitter's character limits. Imgur - Reddit's go-to image hosting site - uses a similar style for their links. Monotonically increasing IDs represented in Base62. 

Your task today is to convert a number to its Base62 representation.

# Input Description
You'll be given one number per line. Assume this is your alphabet:


```
0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```
Example input:


```
15674
7026425611433322325
```
# Output Description
Your program should emit the number represented in Base62 notation. Examples:


```
O44
bDcRfbr63n8
```
# Challenge Input

```
187621
237860461
2187521
18752
```
# Challenge Output

```
9OM
3n26g
B4b9
sS4
```
# Note
Oops, I have the resulting strings backwards as noted in this thread. Solve it either way, but if you wish make a note as many are doing. Sorry about that.
