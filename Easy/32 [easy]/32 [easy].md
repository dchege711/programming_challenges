For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

lets simulate a roulette wheel!
a program that takes as input your bet, and gives as output how much you won, with the appropriate probability

write a program that will take a players bet and output the resulting spin and payout.
try using an american roulette wheel (which has the 00 slot) to add a slight twist. and try to incorporate as many complex bets as you can to. a comprehensive list can be found here
