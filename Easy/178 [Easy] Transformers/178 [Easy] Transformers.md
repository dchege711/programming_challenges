Or, rather, transformations. Today we'll be doing a bit of basic geometry. We'll be writing a program which will take a point in 2-dimensional space, represented as (X, Y) (where X and Y can be decimal and negative), transform them a number of times in different ways and then find the final position of the point.


```
(X, Y)
```
Your program must be able to do the following:

Translations - ie. offsetting the X and Y co-ordinates by a given amount http://i.imgur.com/3jI4sGI.png

Rotations by an arbitrary angle around a given point http://i.imgur.com/9c0ji7c.png

Scale relative to a point http://i.imgur.com/vHUfXv2.png

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input
You will take an starting point (X, Y), such as:


```
(X, Y)
```

```
(3, 4)
```
On new lines, you will then take commands in the format:


```
translate(A, B)     - translate by (A, B)
rotate(A, B, C)     - rotate around (A, B) by angle C (in radians) clockwise
scale(A, B, C)      - scale relative to (A, B) with scale-factor C
reflect(axis)       - reflect over the given axis
finish()            - end input and print the modified location
```
Where axis is one of X or Y.


```
axis
```

```
X
```

```
Y
```
## Output
Print the final value of (X, Y) in the format:


```
(X, Y)
```

```
(2.5, -0.666666)
```
# Test Case
## Test Case Input

```
(0, 5)
translate(3, 2)
scale(1,3,0.5)
rotate(3,2,1.57079632679)
reflect(X) 
translate(2,-1)
scale(0,0,-0.25)
rotate(1,-3,3.14159265359)
reflect(Y)
```
## Test Case Output

```
(-4, -7)
```
# Notes
I want to say two things. First, this may be a good opportunity to learn your language's 2-D drawing capabilities - every time a command is given, represent it on an image like I have done with the examples, so you can see the path the co-ordinate has taken. Secondly, this is a multi-part challenge. I'm not sure how many parts there will be, however it may be a good idea to prepare for more possible commands (or, if you're crazy enough to use Prolog - you know who you are - write an EBNF parser like last time, lol.) If you know how, it would be clever to start using matrices for transformations now rather than later.
