#  (Easy): Braille
(#EasyIcon)
Braille is a writing system based on a series of raised / lowered bumps on a material, for the purpose of being read through touch rather than sight. It's an incredibly powerful reading & writing system for those who are blind / visually impaired. Though the letter system has up to 64 unique glyph, 26 are used in English Braille for letters. The rest are used for numbers, words, accents, ligatures, etc.

Your goal is to read in a string of Braille characters (using standard English Braille defined here) and print off the word in standard English letters. You only have to support the 26 English letters.
