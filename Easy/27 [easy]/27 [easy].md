For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that accepts a year as input and outputs the century the year belongs in (e.g. 18th century's year ranges are 1701 to 1800) and whether or not the year is a leap year.  Pseudocode for leap year can be found here.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm)
Sample run:

Enter Year:  1996

Century:  20

Leap Year: Yes

Enter Year:  1900

Century:  19

Leap Year:  No
