# [29 (easy)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/r8a70/3222012_challenge_29_easy/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

A Palindrome is a sequence that is the same in reverse as it is forward.

(http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Palindrome)
I.e. hannah, 12321.

Your task is to write a function to determine whether a given string is palindromic or not.

Bonus:  Support multiple lines in your function to validate Demetri Martin's 224 word palindrome poem.
