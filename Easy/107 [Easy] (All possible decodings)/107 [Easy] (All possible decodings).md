For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Consider the translation from letters to numbers a -> 1 through z -> 26. Every sequence of letters can be translated into a string of numbers this way, with the numbers being mushed together. For instance hello -> 85121215. Unfortunately the reverse translation is not unique. 85121215 could map to hello, but also to heaubo. Write a program that, given a string of digits, outputs every possible translation back to letters.


```
a -> 1
```

```
z -> 26
```

```
hello -> 85121215
```

```
85121215
```

```
hello
```

```
heaubo
```
Sample input:

123


```
123
```
Sample output:

abc


```
abc
```
aw


```
aw
```
lc


```
lc
```
