# [163 (Easy) Probability Distribution of a 6 Sided Di](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/25y2d0/5192014_challenge_163_easy_probability/)

# Description:
Today's challenge we explore some curiosity in rolling a 6 sided di. I often wonder about the outcomes of a rolling a simple 6 side di in a game or even simulating the roll on a computer.

I could roll a 6 side di and record the results. This can be time consuming, tedious and I think it is something a computer can do very well.

So what I want to do is simulate rolling a 6 sided di in 6 groups and record how often each number 1-6 comes up. Then print out a fancy chart comparing the data. What I want to see is if I roll the 6 sided di more often does the results flatten out in distribution of the results or is it very chaotic and have spikes in what numbers can come up.

So roll a D6 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 times and each time record how often a 1-6 comes up and produce a chart of % of each outcome.

Run the program one time or several times and decide for yourself. Does the results flatten out over time? Is it always flat? Spikes can occur?

# Input:
None.

# Output:
Show a nicely formatted chart showing the groups of rolls and the percentages of results coming up for human analysis.

## example:

```
# of Rolls 1s     2s     3s     4s     5s     6s       
====================================================
10         18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
100        18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
1000       18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
10000      18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
100000     18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
1000000    18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
```
notes on example output:

# Code Submission + Conclusion:
Do not just post your code. Also post your conclusion based on the simulation output. Have fun and enjoy not having to tally 1 million rolls by hand.
