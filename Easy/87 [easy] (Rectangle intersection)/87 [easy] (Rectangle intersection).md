# [87 (easy) (Rectangle intersection)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/y26pr/8102012_challenge_87_easy_rectangle_intersection/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function that calculates the intersection of two rectangles, returning either a new rectangle or some kind of null value. 

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory))
You're free to represent these rectangles in any way you want: tuples of numbers, class objects, new datatypes, anything goes. For this challenge, you'll probably want to represent your rectangles as the x and y values of the top-left and bottom-right points. (Rect(3, 3, 10, 10) would be a rectangle from (3, 3) (top-left) to (10, 10) (bottom-right).)


```
Rect(3, 3, 10, 10)
```

```
(3, 3)
```

```
(10, 10)
```
As an example, rectIntersection(Rect(3, 3, 10 10), Rect(6, 6, 12, 12)) would return Rect(6, 6, 10, 10), while rectIntersection(Rect(4, 4, 5, 5), Rect(6, 6, 10 10)) would return null.


```
rectIntersection(Rect(3, 3, 10 10), Rect(6, 6, 12, 12))
```

```
Rect(6, 6, 10, 10)
```

```
rectIntersection(Rect(4, 4, 5, 5), Rect(6, 6, 10 10))
```
