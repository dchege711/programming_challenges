For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Your challenge today is to write a program that can draw a checkered grid (like a chessboard) to any dimension. For instance, a 3 by 8 board might look like this: 


```
*********************************
*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
*********************************
*###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
*###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
*###*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *
*********************************
*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
*   *###*   *###*   *###*   *###*
*********************************
```
Yours doesn't have to look like mine, you can make it look any way you want (now that I think of it, mine looks kinda bad, actually). Also try to make it scalable, so that if you want to make a 2 by 5 board, but with bigger squares, it would print out:


```
*******************************
*     *#####*     *#####*     *
*     *#####*     *#####*     *
*     *#####*     *#####*     *
*     *#####*     *#####*     *
*     *#####*     *#####*     *
*******************************
*#####*     *#####*     *#####*
*#####*     *#####*     *#####*
*#####*     *#####*     *#####*
*#####*     *#####*     *#####*
*#####*     *#####*     *#####*
*******************************
```
Have fun!
