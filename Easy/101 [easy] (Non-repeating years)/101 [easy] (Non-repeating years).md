For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

This challenge comes to us from user skeeto

(/u/skeeto)
Write a program to count the number years in an inclusive range of years that have no repeated digits.

For example, 2012 has a repeated digit (2) while 2013 does not. Given the range [1980, 1987], your program would return 7 (1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987).

Bonus: Compute the longest run of years of repeated digits and the longest run of years of non-repeated digits for [1000, 2013].
