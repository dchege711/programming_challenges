# [82 (easy) (Substring list)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/x8rl8/7272012_challenge_82_easy_substring_list/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function that takes a number n as an argument and returns (or outputs) every possible unique substrings (not counting "") of the first n letters of the alphabet (in any order you like). For example, substrings(5) could be:


```
substrings(5)
```

```
a
ab
abc
abcd
abcde
b
bc
bcd
bcde
c
cd
cde
d
de
e
```
BONUS 1: Find a way to quickly determine how many strings this function returns for a given input. If the alphabet were 500 letters long, how much possible substrings would it have?

BONUS 2: Modify your function to take a string as an argument. Make sure all substrings in your output are still unique (i.e., there are two "l" substrings in "hello", but you should output only one).
