For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that will accept a sentence as input and then output that sentence surrounded by some type of an ASCII decoratoin banner.

Sample run:

Enter a sentence:  So long and thanks for all the fish

Output


```
*****************************************
*                                       *
*  So long and thanks for all the fish  *
*                                       *
*****************************************
```
Bonus:  If the sentence is too long, move words to the next line.
