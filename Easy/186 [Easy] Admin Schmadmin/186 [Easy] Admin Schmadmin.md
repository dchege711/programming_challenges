# [186 (Easy) Admin Schmadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2kh2tz/10272014_challenge_186_easy_admin_schmadmin/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
"I'm sorry we had to call you in at such small notice but our last admin royally screwed us over. I don't suppose you can have a scout through the files and see if there's any remnants of that slimeball left in our system can you? Any leftover documents, programs, CV's, ANYTHING you can find about him, I need it so I can finish him."

A few weeks pass

...Congratulations! 

You've been hired as a temp to do some administrative duties that involve digging through the records of the filesystem in search for any hints as to where the ex-employee may have fled to. But first, you'll need some training. I've assigned you a few simple tasks that should build your command line skills to that of an adequate admin. 

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
For this task, you are given a tasklist of tasks to perform. Each task has a bulleted point and a summary. The bulleted point contains the dialogue of what the manager wants you to perform, the summary can be seen as a sort of 'technical overview' of what needs to be done.

## Input description
As input, you are expected to execute commands into your terminal that correspond to the given task on the tasklist.

## Output description
The program should output the expected output of your command.

# Tasklist
"Okay employee, I've hired you now get to work! Listen carefully to what I have to say, I'm not going to say it twice!..."

Summary : Get the 20 last used documents from the system and sort by the date they were modified.

Summary : Output the above command to a .txt file. 

Summary : Retrieve the last 10 commands used on the console.

Summary :  Get the 10 most CPU-heavy processes in descending order.

Summary : Retrieve the last 20 error logs/messages and output these as a formatted HTML table 

Summary : Retrieve all txt/pdf/exe files on the machine (You do not need to do the whole machine, just 1 drive is enough, or less if your machine is struggling).

"Thanks kid, you saved our bacon! Now get out."

# Notes/Hints
Beginners, consider using a shell environent for this. For windows I recommend Powershell. I'm not a Unix man but I hear the default shell is more than up to this task. Doing this in a programming language will prove to be a lot of work, choose a shell if you want your sanity.

# Finally
Have a good challenge idea?
