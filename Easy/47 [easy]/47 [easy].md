For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Your task today is to implement one of the oldest ciphers known, the so-called Caesar cipher (or Caesar shift, as it is sometimes called). It works like this: for every letter you want to encrypt, you shift it some number of places down the alphabet to get the letter in the cipher. 

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
So, for instance, in a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3, "A" becomes "D", "B" becomes "E", "C" becomes "F", and so on. At the end of the alphabet it wraps around, so "W" becomes "Z", "X" becomes "A", "Y" becomes "B" and "Z" becomes "C". If you encrypt "Hello" with a shift of 3, you get "Khoor".

One interesting thing about this cipher is that you can use the same algorithm to decode a cipher as you can to encode it: if you wish to decrypt some text that has been Caesar-shifted 6 places, you simply shift it another 20 places to get back the original text. For example, if you encrypt "Daily programmer"  with a shift of 6 you get "Jgore vxumxgsskx", and if you encrypt "Jgore vxumxgsskx" with a shift of 20 you get "Daily programmer".

Implement the cipher and encrypt a bit of text of your choice!

Bonus: Using your program, become a code-cracker and decrypt this cipher (posted in honor of Mayday):
