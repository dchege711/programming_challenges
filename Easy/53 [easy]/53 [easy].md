# [53 (easy)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/tpxq9/5162012_challenge_53_easy/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a function that given two sorted lists, returns a list whith the two lists merged together into one sorted list. 

So, for instance, for inputs [1,5,7,8] and [2,3,4,7,9] it should return [1,2,3,4,5,7,7,8,9]. 

Try and make your code as efficient as possible.
