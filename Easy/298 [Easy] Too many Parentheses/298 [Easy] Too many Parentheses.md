# [298 (Easy) Too many Parentheses](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5llkbj/2017012_challenge_298_easy_too_many_parentheses/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Difficulty may be higher than easy,

(((3))) is an expression with too many parentheses.


```
(((3)))
```
The rule for "too many parentheses" around part of an expression is that if removing matching parentheses around a section of text still leaves that section enclosed by parentheses, then those parentheses should be removed as extraneous.

(3) is the proper stripping of extra parentheses in above example.


```
(3)
```
((a((bc)(de)))f) does not have any extra parentheses.  Removing any matching set of parentheses does not leave a "single" parenthesesed group that was previously enclosed by the parentheses in question.


```
((a((bc)(de)))f)
```
inputs:


```
((a((bc)(de)))f)  
(((zbcd)(((e)fg))))
ab((c))
```
outputs: 


```
((a((bc)(de)))f)  
((zbcd)((e)fg))
ab(c)
```
# bonus
A 2nd rule of too many parentheses can be that parentheses enclosing nothing are not needed, and so should be removed.  A/white space would not be nothing.

inputs: 


```
()
  ((fgh()()()))
  ()(abc())
```
outputs: 


```
NULL
  (fgh)
  (abc)
```
