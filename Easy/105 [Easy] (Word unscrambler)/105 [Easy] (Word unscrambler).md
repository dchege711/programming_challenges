# [105 (Easy) (Word unscrambler)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/11shra/10202012_challenge_105_easy_word_unscrambler/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Given a wordlist of your choosing, make a program to unscramble scrambled words from that list. For sanity and brevity, disregard any words which have ambiguous unscramlings, such as "dgo" unscrambling to both "dog" and "god."

Input:

A file which contains scrambled words and a wordlist to match it against

Output:

The unscrambled words which match the scrambled ones
