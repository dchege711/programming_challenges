# Description
A number of sailors (let's call it N) are stranded on an island with a huge pile of coconuts and a monkey. During the night, each sailor (in turn) does the following without the others knowing: 

In the morning, they split the remaining coconuts between them. This time the split is even. There's nothing left over for the monkey.

Your task: Given the number of sailors (N), how many coconuts were in the pile to begin with (lowest possible number)?

# Formal inputs/outputs
## Input
The input is a single number: N, the number of sailors. This number is a whole number that is greater than or equal to 2.

## Output
The output is a single number: the number of coconuts in the original pile. 

## Sample input/output
Input:


```
5
```
