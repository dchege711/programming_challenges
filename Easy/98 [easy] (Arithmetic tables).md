For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that reads two arguments from the command line:


```
+
```

```
-
```

```
*
```

```
/
```
And uses them to output a nice table for the operation from 0 to n, like this (for "+ 4"):


```
+  |  0  1  2  3  4
-------------------
0  |  0  1  2  3  4 
1  |  1  2  3  4  5
2  |  2  3  4  5  6
3  |  3  4  5  6  7
4  |  4  5  6  7  8
```
If you want, you can format your output using the reddit table syntax:


```
|+|0|1
|:|:|:
|**0**|0|1
|**1**|1|2
```
Becomes this:


|+|0|1|
| --- | --- | --- |
|0|0|1|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|1|2|
| --- | --- | --- |
|
----
