For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Imagine each letter and its position within the alphabet. Now assign each letter its corresponding value ie a=1, b=2,... z=26. When given a list of words, order the words by the sum of the values of the letters in their names.

Example: Shoe and Hat

Hat: 8+1+20 = 29

Shoe: 19+8+15+5 = 47

So the order would be Hat, Shoe.

For extra points, divide by the sum by the number of letters in that word and then rank them.
