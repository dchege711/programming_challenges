# [5 (easy)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/pnhyn/2122012_challenge_5_easy/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Your challenge for today is to create a program which is password protected, and wont open unless the correct user and password is given. 

For extra credit, have the user and password in a seperate .txt file.

for even more extra credit, break into your own program :)
