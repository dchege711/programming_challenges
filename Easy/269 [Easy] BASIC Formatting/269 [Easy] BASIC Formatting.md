# [269 (Easy) BASIC Formatting](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4lpygb/20160530_challenge_269_easy_basic_formatting/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
It's the year 2095. In an interesting turn of events, it was decided 50 years ago that BASIC
is by far the universally best language. You work for a company by the name of SpaceCorp, who
has recently merged with a much smaller company MixCo. While SpaceCorp has rigorous formatting
guidelines, exactly 4 space per level of indentation, MixCo developers seem to format however
they please at the moment. Your job is to bring MixCo's development projects up to standards.

# Input Description
You'll be given a number N, representing the number of lines of BASIC code.
Following that will be a line containing the text to use for indentation, which will
be ···· for the purposes of visibility. Finally, there will be N lines of
pseudocode mixing indentation types (space and tab, represented by · and » for visibility)
that need to be reindented.


```
····
```

```
·
```

```
»
```
Blocks are denoted by IF and ENDIF, as well as FOR and NEXT.


```
IF
```

```
ENDIF
```

```
FOR
```

```
NEXT
```
# Output Description
You should output the BASIC indented by SpaceCorp guidelines.

# Challenge Input

```
12
····
VAR I
·FOR I=1 TO 31
»»»»IF !(I MOD 3) THEN
··PRINT "FIZZ"
··»»ENDIF
»»»»····IF !(I MOD 5) THEN
»»»»··PRINT "BUZZ"
··»»»»»»ENDIF
»»»»IF (I MOD 3) && (I MOD 5) THEN
······PRINT "FIZZBUZZ"
··»»ENDIF
»»»»·NEXT
```
# Challenge Output

```
VAR I
FOR I=1 TO 31
····IF !(I MOD 3) THEN
········PRINT "FIZZ"
····ENDIF
····IF !(I MOD 5) THEN
········PRINT "BUZZ"
····ENDIF
····IF (I MOD 3) && (I MOD 5) THEN
········PRINT "FIZZBUZZ"
····ENDIF
NEXT
```
# Bonus
Give an error code for mismatched or missing statements. For example, this has a missing ENDIF:


```
ENDIF
```

```
FOR I=0 TO 10
····IF I MOD 2 THEN
········PRINT I
NEXT
```
This has a missing ENDIF and a missing NEXT:


```
ENDIF
```

```
NEXT
```

```
FOR I=0 TO 10
····IF I MOD 2 THEN
········PRINT I
```
This has an ENDIF with no IF and a FOR with no NEXT:


```
ENDIF
```

```
IF
```

```
FOR
```

```
NEXT
```

```
FOR I=0 TO 10
····PRINT I
ENDIF
```
This has an extra ENDIF:


```
ENDIF
```

```
FOR I=0 TO 10
····PRINT I
NEXT
ENDIF
```
