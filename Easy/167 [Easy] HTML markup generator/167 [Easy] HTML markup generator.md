# [167 (Easy) HTML markup generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/289png/6162014_challenge_167_easy_html_markup_generator/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
You're a well known web-dev with far too much confidence, you mistakingly agreed to complete too many projects in too little a timeframe. In order to fix this, you devise a program that will automatically write all of the HTML for you!

But first, you'll need to program it.

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input description
On standard console input you should be prompted to enter a paragraph.

## Output description
Once your paragraph has been entered, it should be saved as a valid HTML file and opened in your default brower to display the results

# Sample Inputs & Outputs
## Input

```
"Enter your paragraph:"
"This is my paragraph entry"
```
## Output
(this is the expected content of the .html file)


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>This is my paragraph entry</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
# Bonus
Implement a good looking default CSS style-sheet that also gets automatically generated.

# Notes
Have a good challenge idea?
