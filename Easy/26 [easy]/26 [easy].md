For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

you have a string "ddaaiillyypprrooggrraammeerr". We want to remove all the consecutive duplicates and put them in a separate string, which yields two separate instances of the string "dailyprogramer".

use this list for testing:

input: "balloons"

expected output: "balons" "lo"

input: "ddaaiillyypprrooggrraammeerr"

expected output: "dailyprogramer" "dailyprogramer"

input: "aabbccddeded"

expected output: "abcdeded" "abcd"

input: "flabby aapples"

expected output: "flaby aples" "bap"
