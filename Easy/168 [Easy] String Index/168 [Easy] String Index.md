# [168 (Easy) String Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/299hvt/6272014_challenge_168_easy_string_index/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# What no hard?:
So my originally planned [Hard] has issues. So it is not ready for posting. I don't have another [Hard] so we are gonna do a nice [Easy] one for Friday for all of us to enjoy.

# Description:
We know arrays. We index into them to get a value. What if we could apply this to a string? But the index finds a "word". Imagine being able to parse the words in a string by giving an index. This can be useful for many reasons.

Example: 

Say you have the String "The lazy cat slept in the sunlight."

If you asked for the Word at index 3 you would get "cat" back. If you asked for the Word at index 0 you get back an empty string "". Why an empty string at 0? Because we will not use a 0 index but our index begins at 1. If you ask for word at index 8 you will get back an empty string as the string only has 7 words. Any negative index makes no sense and return an empty string "".

# Rules to parse:
# Challenge Input:
Your string:
      "...You...!!!@!3124131212 Hello have this is a --- string   Solved !!...?  to test @\n\n\n#!#@#@%$**#$@  Congratz this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!one ---Problem\n\n"

Find the words at these indexes and display them with a " " between them: 12 -1 1 -100 4 1000 9 -1000 16 13 17 15
