# [42 (easy)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/sobna/4232012_challenge_42_easy/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that prints out the lyrics for "Ninety-nine bottles of beer", "Old McDonald had a farm" or "12 days of Christmas".

If you choose "Ninety-nine bottles of beer", you need to spell out the number, not just write the digits down. It's "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall", not "99 bottles of beer"!

For Old McDonald, you need to include at least 6 animals: a cow, a chicken, a turkey, a kangaroo, a T-Rex and an animal of your choosing (Old McDonald has a weird farm). The cow goes "moo", the chicken goes "cluck", the turkey goes "gobble", the kangaroo goes "g'day mate" and the T-Rex goes "GAAAAARGH". You can have more animals if you like. 

Make your code shorter than the song it prints out!
