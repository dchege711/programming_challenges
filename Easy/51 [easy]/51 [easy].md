For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Write a program that given an array A and a number N, generates all combinations of items in A of length N.

That is, if you are given the array [1,2,3,4,5] and 3, you're supposed to generate

Note that order doesn't matter when counting combinations, both [1,2,3] and [3,2,1] are considered the same. Order also doesn't matter in the output of the combinations, as long as you generate all of them, you don't have to worry about what order they pop out. You can also assume that every element of the array is distinct.
