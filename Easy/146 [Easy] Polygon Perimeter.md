#  (Easy): Polygon Perimeter
(#EasyIcon)
A Polygon is a geometric two-dimensional figure that has n-sides (line segments) that closes to form a loop. Polygons can be in many different shapes and have many different neat properties, though this challenge is about Regular Polygons. Our goal is to compute the permitter of an n-sided polygon that has equal-length sides given the circumradius. This is the distance between the center of the Polygon to any of its vertices; not to be confused with the apothem!

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Input Description
Input will consist of one line on standard console input. This line will contain first an integer N, then a floating-point number R. They will be space-delimited. The integer N is for the number of sides of the Polygon, which is between 3 to 100, inclusive. R will be the circumradius, which ranges from 0.01 to 100.0, inclusive.

## Output Description
Print the permitter of the given N-sided polygon that has a circumradius of R. Print up to three digits precision.
