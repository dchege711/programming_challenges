For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
The inhabitants of the planet Splurth are building their own periodic table of the elements. Just like Earth's periodic table has a chemical symbol for each element (H for Hydrogen, Li for Lithium, etc.), so does Splurth's. However, their chemical symbols must follow certain rules:

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table#Overview)

```
H
```

```
Li
```

```
B
```

```
Hg
```

```
Cy
```

```
Vr
```

```
Rv
```

```
Ma
```

```
Am
```

```
a
```

```
m
```

```
m
```

```
a
```

```
Nn
```

```
Xx
```

```
Oo
```
As a member of the Splurth Council of Atoms and Atom-Related Paraphernalia, you must determine whether a proposed chemical symbol fits these rules.

# Details
Write a function that, given two strings, one an element name and one a proposed symbol for that element, determines whether the symbol follows the rules. If you like, you may parse the program's input and output the result, but this is not necessary.

The symbol will have exactly two letters. Both element name and symbol will contain only the letters a-z. Both the element name and the symbol will have their first letter capitalized, with the rest lowercase. (If you find that too challenging, it's okay to instead assume that both will be completely lowercase.)

# Examples

```
Spenglerium, Ee -> true
Zeddemorium, Zr -> true
Venkmine, Kn -> true
Stantzon, Zt -> false
Melintzum, Nn -> false
Tullium, Ty -> false
```
# Optional bonus challenges

```
Gozerium -> Ei
```

```
Slimyrine -> Ie
```

```
Zuulon -> 11
```

```
Zuulon
```

```
N
```

```
Uuo
```

```
Zuuln
```

```
Zuulon -> 47
```
