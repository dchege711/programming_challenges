# [233 (Easy) The house that ASCII built](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3ltee2/20150921_challenge_233_easy_the_house_that_ascii/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Description
Christopher has always dreamed of living in a really fancy ASCII house, and he's finally decided to make it happen. He works in a hedgefund and has made a lot of money in the Unicode markets (buying cheap Cyrillic code-points and selling them to Russia), and he feels like he's finally able to afford it. 

He hires Melinda the ASCII architect, who designs and delivers the following asterisk blue-print:


```
*
  ***
******
```
To make this beautiful drawing into reality, he hires Lilly the ASCII contractor to build it. It takes a few months, but finally Lilly delivers this beautiful creation: 


```
A
             / \
    A     A +---+ A
   / \   / \|   |/ \
  /   \ +---+   +---+ A
 /     \| o         |/ \
+-------+           +---+
|     o      | |      o | 
+-----------------------+
```
In case it isn't clear: the o's are windows, the A's are the tops of the roof, and the | | is a door. Notice that each asterisk has been transformed into a box that is 5 characters wide and 3 characters tall (and notice that two neighboring boxes share an edge). 


```
o
```

```
A
```

```
| |
```
Today, you are to step into the shoes of Lilly the ASCII contractor! You are to be given an ASCII blueprint of a house, which you will then turn in to glorious reality.

# Formal inputs & outputs
## Inputs
On the first line, you will recieve a number telling you how many lines the blueprint will occupy. 

After that, you will recieve some number of lines containing the blueprint. Each line is guaranteed to be less than 30 characters long. The only two characters allowed in the lines are spaces and asterisks, and there are a two assumptions you can make regarding the asterisks: 

## Outputs
You will draw that the input asterisks describe. 

There are four essential features of the ASCII house:

```
o
```
The roofs: Each asterisk that has no asterisk above it should have a roof over it. The roof is made of /, \ and A characters. If there are two or more boxes next to each other which don't have any boxes above them, they should share a wider roof. In other words, if you have three boxes next to each other without any boxes on top, then this is right: 


```
/
```

```
\
```

```
A
```

```
A 
     / \ 
    /   \ 
   /     \  
  /       \ 
 /         \ 
+-----------+
|           | 
+-----------+
```
And this is wrong:


```
A   A   A
 / \ / \ / \
+-----------+
|           | 
+-----------+
```
You are given large leeway in which of these features you choose to implement. At a minimum, you should make your program draw the outline of the house according to the blueprint, but if you don't want to implement the windows, doors and roofs, that's fine. 

# Sample inputs and outputs
Given that there's a random component in this challenge (where the doors and windows are located), your outputs obviously don't have to match these character-by-charcter.
