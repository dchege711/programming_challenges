# [22 - September, 2017) Procedural Bacteria   Fungus   Virus](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/6xr1c0/monthly_challenge_22_september_2017_procedural/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Alright, I'm starting this month's on time because for the first time nobody entered a procgen contest! Sorry if you guys didn't like it! (Or maybe everyone's too busy enjoying the summer?)

Anyway, I've got another one coming straight at you from the Topic Suggestions Thread. You guys liked it there so let's make this the biggest challenge ever! 

(https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/5mb216/2017_monthly_challenge_topic_suggestions/)
Bacteria, protozoa, amoebas, viruses, tiny lifeforms! Humans produce these guys all day, so I think it's about time for your computer to get in on the action and generate some new ones. Some of you may be inspired by Spore's first level. Or enjoy looking in microscopes or textbooks at bacteria and viruses. Whatever tiny lifeform, you can make it!
